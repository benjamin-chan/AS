## Objectives

See [`EPD217_AS Comorbidities Study_Protocol_2017-05-18_APPROVED.pdf`](background/EPD217_AS Comorbidities Study_Protocol_2017-05-18_APPROVED.pdf) for study protocol.

> The main research question is whether TNFi have changed the natural history
> of AS by reducing the incidence of AS-related comorbidities. The study
> objectives are (1) to investigate the prevalence of AS in insurance claims
> databases, (2) to identify the prevalence of comorbidities in AS patients
> compared to a non- AS general population sample, and (3) to compare the
> incidence of AS-related comorbidities across the following groups of AS
> patients: those managed with either no therapy or prescription non-steroidal
> anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), those given traditional disease modifying
> anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS), and those using TNFi.


## Directory structure

* `background` Background documentation
* `data` Data files
  * `processed` Output data files generated by scripts
  * `raw` Raw data files not generated by scripts
* `formats` Templates for use in scripts run on the UAB server (see [`BRONCHIECTASIS_project.md`](background/BRONCHIECTASIS_project.md))
* `lib` Function libraries for scripts
* `output` Output of scripts (`.html`, `.log`, `.txt`, and `.md` files)
* `scripts` Scripts

The scripts use relative paths.
They are designed to work in any parent-level directory with the above structure.


## Project build

First, execute the [`script.bat`](scripts/script.bat) script on the UAB PEER server.

```
U:\studies\AS\pgms\bchan\scripts\script.bat
```

Next, post-process data locally using the Windows batch script, [`postprocess.bat`](scripts/postprocess.bat).

```
source("scripts/postprocess.bat")
```

## Reproducibility

To recreate this analysis in this Git repository, execute `script.R` from the `scripts` directory.

```
$ cd scripts
$ /usr/bin/Rscript script.R
```

R package versions are listed in [`scripts/session.log`](scripts/session.log).
