NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.

NOTE: Under full-rank parameterizations, Type 3 effect tests are replaced by joint tests.  The joint test for an effect is a test that all of the 
      parameters associated with that effect are zero.  Such joint tests might not be equivalent to Type 3 effect tests under GLM parameterization.
