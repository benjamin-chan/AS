116        Hi, Ben
117        
118        The data are stored at UCB library defined as below email.
119        
120        Attached please find the cohort list.
121        
122        No exclusion was done except excluded for higher level exposure in six month
123        baseline.
124        
125        You need to do appropriate censor (such as censor for discontinues of
126        exposure, switch to same level or higher lever exposure ...).
127        
128        If you have question, please let me know.
