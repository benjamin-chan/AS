167        Hi, Ben
168        
169        The data are stored at UCB library defined as below email.
170        
171        Attached please find the cohort list.
172        
173        No exclusion was done except excluded for higher level exposure in six month
174        baseline.
175        
176        You need to do appropriate censor (such as censor for discontinues of
177        exposure, switch to same level or higher lever exposure ...).
178        
179        If you have question, please let me know.
